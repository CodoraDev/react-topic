##  ‚ú® Install
`npm install --save @codora/react-topic` 

## üëâ Import
`import {Topic, useTopic} from "@codora/react-topic";`

##  üöÄ Demo
Coming Soon...

## üî¨ Use Topic
Add the `<Topic>` context any where in your app. Add it near the root if you want to use topics for your whole app. 
```tsx
import {Topic} from "@codora/react-topic";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Topic>
      //...
    </Topic>
  )
}
```

You will then have access to `useTopic`. It takes one argument, which will be the topic name, and one type argument, which will be the topic type. 

`useTopic` will return two functions: `publish` and `subscribe`
```tsx
import {useTopic} from "@codora/react-topic";

type User = {
    name
}
const SomeComponent = () => {
    const {publish, subscribe} =useTopic<User>("user")

    //...
```
`publish` is quite simple. All you need to do is pass in the data. This will add the data to its topic collection and send out an event to any subscribers.

```tsx
//...

const newUser: User = buildUser();

<button onclick={()=> 
    publish(newUser) 
}>
    Add User
</button>

//...
```

`subscribe` will have to be used with in a useEffect for it to stay open and subscribed. `subscribe` will return an `unSubscribe` function which should be called when ever you do not need the subscription, else there will be a memory leak in your application. 

The first argument is an `onSubscribe` function which is the callback function that will be called on an event. `onSubscribe` as two input arguments. The first is the topic updated collection array. We pass whole topic array with each event as it feels the most natural when making web applications. The second input argument is the `event` that was sent. In this event will hold the individual topic.

```tsx
//...

  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([])
  const [event, setEvent] = useState<Event<User>>()

  useEffect(() => {
    const unSubscribe = subscribe((users, event) => {
      setUsers(users)
      setEvent(event)
    })
    return () => {
      unSubscribe()
    }
  }, []) 

//...
```
